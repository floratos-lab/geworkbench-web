<p>
	<Strong>geWorkbench (genomics Workbench)</Strong> is an open source
	application that provides access to an integrated suite of tools for
	the analysis and visualization of data from a wide range of genomics
	domains (gene expression, sequence, protein structure and systems
	biology). <a href="http://www.geworkbench.org/"
		style="color: #B83F45; font-weight: bold;">The full desktop
		version of geWorkbench</a> has more than 70 distinct plug-in modules
	implementing both classical analyses (several variants of clustering,
	classification, homology detection, etc.) as well as state of the art
	algorithms for the reverse engineering of regulatory networks and for
	protein structure prediction, among many others.
</p>

<p>This site (geWorkbench-Web) provides a web interface to a subset
	of plug-ins. Over time, we expect that all geWorkbench modules will be
	available through the web interface.</p>

<p>
	geWorkbench and geWorkbench-Web are funded through <a
		href="http://magnet.c2b2.columbia.edu/"
		style="color: #B83F45; font-weight: bold;">MAGNet</a>, the National
	Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks.
	MAGNet is a member of the National Centers for Biomedical Computing (<a
